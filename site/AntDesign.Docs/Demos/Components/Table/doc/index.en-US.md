### Responsive

The table supports responsive by default, and when the screen width is less than 960px, the table would switch to small-screen mode.

In small-screen mode, only certain features are currently supported, and mis-styling will occur in tables with some features such as group, expanded columns, tree data, summary cell, etc. 

If you want to disable responsive, you can set `Responsive="false"`.
