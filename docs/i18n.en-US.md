title: Internationalization
---

The internationalization of `Ant Design Blazor` is based on the built-in `LocaleProvider`, and localization is based on the `CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture` provided by the blazor framework, 
refer to the document [ASP.NET Core Blazor globalization and localization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/globalization-localization?view=aspnetcore-3.1#localization) for more details.

By default, the current language is fetched from the browser. If you need to use another language, you can configure it at initialization time or change it at run time. Please refer to the following scheme.

## localization configuration

```csharp

 // Set current language
 LocaleProvider.SetLocale("en-US");
 
```

## Change locale at run time

`Ant Design Blazor` can use `CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture` to dynamically change the localization.

```csharp

 // Changing it anywhere can switch the language of the current thread.
 CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US");

```

The default is set to "en-US" when the language you set does not have a built-in language pack.
You can also add it by using the 'LocaleProvider.SetLocale' method.

```csharp

 // Create a `Locale` object
 var zhHK = new Locale { ... };
 // Set an additional language
 LocaleProvider.SetLocale("zh-HK", zhHK);
 
```

Note: `en-US` is the package name, follow below.
